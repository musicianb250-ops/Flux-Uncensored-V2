The **FLUX Uncensored LoRA v2** is an enhanced version of the original FLUX Uncensored LoRA, designed for the base model `black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev`. This version addresses issues present in the previous release and offers improved performance and stability. The LoRA weights have been fine-tuned to remove the base model's content restrictions, allowing for the generation of NSFW (Not Safe For Work) and other uncensored content.

This LoRA extension can be loaded into the `FLUX.1-dev` pipeline using the `diffusers` library. It is optimized for high-quality, explicit image generation based on user-provided prompts. The model is intended for research and personal use, and adheres to the non-commercial license terms.

> **Warning:** This model allows the generation of explicit content. Users should exercise caution and adhere to legal and ethical guidelines.

## What's New in v2?

- **Improved Performance:** The model has been optimized for better performance and faster generation times.
- **Stability Fixes:** Issues present in the previous version have been addressed, ensuring a more stable and reliable experience.
- **Thinner LoRA Model:** The LoRA weights have been streamlined to reduce the model size without compromising quality.

## How to Use

Below is an example of how to use the FLUX Uncensored LoRA v2 with the `diffusers` library:

```python
from diffusers import AutoPipelineForText2Image
import torch

# Load the base model
pipeline = AutoPipelineForText2Image.from_pretrained("black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16).to('cuda')

# Load the uncensored LoRA weights
pipeline.load_lora_weights('enhanceaiteam/Flux-uncensored-v2', weight_name='lora.safetensors')

# Generate an image with an uncensored NSFW prompt
image = pipeline('a naked cute girl').images[0]
image.show()
```
